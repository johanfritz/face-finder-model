# face-finder-model
This is a deep neural network model for finding faces in images, written in python with the numpy library. The purpose is not to create a model that is better than existing ones but rather for me to develop my skills in deep learning. The first step will be to train a classification for determening wether an image is of a face or not. For this i will be using the LFW dataset. 
# face classification model
This is in development
